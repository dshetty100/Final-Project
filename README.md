# Final  Project

## Selected Topic

## Reason for Choosing Topic

Our team chose these data sets as they are extensive enough with the correct types of data to serve our analytical goals. With the data, we predict to be able to perform descriptive analysis as well as predictive analysis.

## Data Sources 

* expeditions.csv

* members.csv

* peaks.csv


From:  https://www.kaggle.com/

### Data Description:

## Questions to be answered

* What is the likelihood for an expedition to be successful, given certain variable values?

* What parameters must be met for an expedition to be predicted as successful?

For the purposes of these questions, success is defined by the expedition summiting the attempted peak.

##  Communication Protocols 

The team will communicate through Slack as well as attend class sections for instructor help and group work. Additional group time will be scheduled outside of class as needed, primarily on weekends.
