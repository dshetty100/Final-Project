# Final  Project

## Selected Topic

Sponsorship of Himalayan Climbing Expeditions

## Reason for Choosing Topic

The South Palm (an outdoor apparel and equipment company) hired our analytics consulting group to assist in assessing the success probability of a given sponsorship candidate. Our team was able to acquire data sets for individuals, expedition team, and peaks, all within the Himalayan Range.
Using this data, our team is performing exploratory and  predictive analysis to assess success. Features used to complete this analysis include the climber’s gender and age as well the chosen peak, season of scheduled climb,  use of oxygen, and team size the climber intends to be on.

### Data Description:

The data is a compilation of records for all expeditions that have climbed in the Nepal Himalaya. 
It is based on the expedition archives of Elizabeth Hawley, a longtime journalist based in Kathmandu, and it is supplemented 
by information gathered from books, alpine journals and correspondence with Himalayan climbers.

#### Expeditions
Data for each expedition team attempting climbs in the Himalayan Range.

#### Members
Data for each individual on each expedition attempting climbs in Himalayan Range.

#### Peaks
Data for peaks within the Himalayan Range.

## Questions to be answered

Given a person’s age, sex, season of expedition undertaken, the number of members in the team, and peak height, we hope to predict whether the person will succeed in his/her sponsored expedition.

For the purposes of these questions, success is defined by an induvidal summiting the attempted peak and surviving the climb.
