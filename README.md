## Selected Topic

Sponsorship Recommendations for Himalayan Range Climbers

## Reason for Choosing Topic

The South Palm  (an outdoor apparel and equipment company) hired our analytics consulting group to assist in predicting ideal climber sponsorship candidates. Our team was able to acquire data sets for individuals, expedition team, and peaks, all within the Himalayan Range.

## Questions to be answered

In comparing the features of expedittion group size, month of climb, peak height attempted, as well as age and gender of induvidual climbers, is a potential sponsoree likely to be successful, and therefor an ideal candidate for sponsorship.

For the purposes of these questions, success is defined by an induvidal summiting the attempted peak and surviving the climb.


##  Communication Protocols 

The team will communicate through Slack as well as attend class sections for instructor help and group work. Additional group time will be scheduled outside of class as needed, primarily on weekends.
